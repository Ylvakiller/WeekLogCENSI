~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is my log of what I did during the last week, a word version of this log will also be available.
Last week I redesigned the PCB, this due to an error we made when originally making the pcb.
I then tried printing the PCB multiple times, however I could not get the concentration to the correct amount.
After this I worked on documentation of the PCB and how we could configure them.
I calculated all the 80 possibilities with a simple java program which is added to the github (a jar will be supplied in the usb in the DHF at the end as well)
From those 80 possibilities I calculated the addresses that did not conflict with other addresses.
I have found 20 of these, which is plenty for our project.
I wrote documentation on these addresses as well which is in the DHF.
Other than this I worked a lot on my Physics course in Groningen and on non Censi assignments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I think the rest of the group did:
Junior has spent more time famailirising himself with Open GL in gnuplot.
DÃ©bora has been working on understanding the covariance matrices.
