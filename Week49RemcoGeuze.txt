Log of Remco Geuze
Week: 49
Moment of writing: 07-12-2015
Log number: 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is my log of what I did during the last week, a word version of this log will also be available.
Last week I delved into EAGLE, figured out how to work with it and prepare everything for a short workshop for our project group.
In order to do this I needed to make a new eagle library with our component and design our component.
Seeing as how I have not a lot of experience with the EAGLE software this took some time.
I also had a look into what kind of data the sensors send back and wrote a document about that.
I started writing a document on how we should configure the PCB (which resistors we need)
However in order to finish this conclusively I need to write a program that goes through 80 combinations of 4 numbers and then
finds the maximum amount of different combinations we can have without those 4 numbers interfering. 
I gave a short workshop (Roughly 1-1.5 hours) in designing a pcb, 
in which the group as a whole designed the pcb. 
However due to a what seemed to be a problem with the component I made ,
but is instead something we did not know about in eagle I had to redesign the board today (Monday 07-12-2015)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I think the rest of the group did:
According to project meeting we had last week DÃ©bora should be done with determining a test procedure for calculating the covariance matrices.
I have however not been able to verify that.
Junior looked into gnuplot in order to do basic visualisation.
Both group members where active during the designing workshop in pcb design.
