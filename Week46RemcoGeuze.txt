~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is my log of what I did during the last week, a word version of this log will also be available.

The last week I worked on converting the kalman fusion filter from the mathematics to java code. 
In order to test the filter I took the data the from the second kalman filter assignment.
The java program can read in this data and visualise it with graphs (I have never done graphs before in java)
The program allows you to turn graphs on or off based on user input and will allow visualisation of the filtered data.
I am currently building the filter itself, I estimate that this is around 60-70 % done.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I think the rest of the group did:

Here we run into a bit of a problem,
I have not been in on Teusday afternoon, Wednesday morning and Friday morning due to lectures in Groningen.
It might be that my other group members where in during those moments.
However during all the other moments in the week I have seen my group mates once, and that was only for half a minute, they came in, dropped their bags.
I grabbed something to drink and by then they walked out again because they had a meeting.

I am not confident that my group members have done anything productive in the last 2 weeks.
