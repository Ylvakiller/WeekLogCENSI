~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is my log of what I did during the last week before the Christmas break, a word version of this log will also be available.
In the week before the holiday I made the pcb with the correct amount of concentrations and attempted soldering on them.
This was to difficult for me to do using the tools at HIT.
I therefore decided to order the pcb from seeedstudio. This will make soldering easier.
I made a form with all the finances on it for our project. I started working on the final report and transfer reports.
for these I mainly worked on suggestions for a next group along with the explanation of the things I did manage to do during this project.
I did some programming for the interface however I do not have that working as I want it.

I also had a long supervisor meeting with Bryan on Friday which will be discussed in the next section.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I think the rest of the group did:
I have not seen Junior in in that complete week.
Debora has been in. During the project supervisor meeting on week 50 she was once again asked to write a document about covariance matrices.
The main part of this document would be a procedure we could use in order to obtain said matrices for our project.
On Wednesday (the day she was in) I was not in due to locking myself out and having to travel to groningen to get the spare key.
On that day she messaged me asking 
"
	I'm following this paper to calculate the cov matrix.. 
	but it seems pretty complicated.. 
	and I was reading the KF code and it's way more simple. 
	so I don't know what I should do. 
	I mean, I can kind of explain the code into a documentation or I can keep on what I'm doing based on this paper.
	
	I mean
	I know that what Bryan wants is to give me things to do
	but I don't know if it should be based on our code
	or just in general
"
I explained to her we needed a procedure to follow in order to get these matrices.
She said:
"
	yeah.. I see
	
	okay
	it's funny, because in the papers I read they just "skip" this part, give a bunch of equations and say that it was found experimentally hahah
	but okay.. I'll keep on it
"

My reply to that was:
"
	yeah thats the problem
	I think the idea is that one is a noise covariance for the gyro and one for the accelerometer
	So they depend on the behaviour of your sensors
	And therefore you have to run tests
	I mean what we can try is run a test where we know what the outcome would be
	And then keep on trying numbers
	But doing that at random will cost months
	So there probably is a procedure to follow instead
	
	The previous group got decent matrices
	I don't know if they said how they got those
"

This was the only contact I had with her. I did not see her during the rest of that week.

We had a supervisor meeting with Bryan sceduled on Friday.
During which only Bryan and me where present.

The log of this meeting is in my personal log. If you want to read what happened during this meeting contact me.

The word version of this log will be send to Bryan Williams.
The word version will be uploaded to blackboard.(file exchange of this group until we have a different location)
Both the word and the txt versions will be available on github:
