~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following is my log of what I did during the last week, a word version of this log will also be available.
This log is what I did in terms of project work.

During last week I programmed the multi threaded version of the kalman fusion filter,
this includes communicating between threads. 
During the second part of the week I worked with Junior to combine our two sets of code. (see the next section for what he made)
I then added quite a few cpu optimisation methods which will be documented in detail in the DHF.
I spend Thursday and Friday morning on my physics class in Groningen.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I think the rest of the group did:

Junior has been working on communication to the sensors, on Wednesday and Thursday we worked together into combining the two sets of code.
This was finished on Thursday. 
Debora has been working on a FMEA and looked into the covariance matrices.
